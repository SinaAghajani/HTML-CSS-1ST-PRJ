                        2020, he moved to fellow Portuguese side Porto.

                        After becoming the Azadegan League's top scorer, Taremi had offers from many teams. He joined
                        Persepolis FC in the summer of 2014 and signed a two-year contract through June 2016.

                    <h3>Personal life</h3>
                    <p>Taremi is the third and the youngest child of his family. His older brother Mohammad is also a
                        football player.
                        He was in a relationship with Iranian actress Sahar Ghoreishi for months in 2018.In March
                        2020, Taremi announced that he had started a new relationship and is preparing for marriage.
                        On 15 April 2022, Sporting CP, a rival of Taremi's current club FC Porto, published an article
                        on their club website and referred to Taremi as "a true snake charmer, someone from Persia
                        always ready to go and perform circus tricks". The article was met with lots of criticism from
                        both Porto fans and Iranians, including the Iranian Ambassador to Portugal, Morteza Damanpak.
                        The article was later deleted by the club.</p>
